I'm John, a software developer primarily focused on front-end app development with a basic understanding of back-end web development. I work mostly in Javascript, and usually develop using the PERN stacks. My main project right now is a minimalist social network called Froyo. It's main differences from traditional social networks is that it does not profit from selling user data, or serving ads, and does not use addictive algorithims.
