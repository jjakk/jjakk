I'm John, a software developer primarily focused on front-end app development with a basic understanding of back-end web development. I work mostly in Javascript, and usually develop using the PERN stacks. My main project right now is a minimalist social network called <a href='https://froyo.social/'>Froyo</a>. I'm also currently a student at Drexel University studying Software Engineering.
